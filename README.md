- 👋 Hi, I’m @DjamboOfficial
- 👀 I’m interested in learning the basics of coding, and most importantly joining a community that can help me to do so.
- 🌱 I’m currently getting the hangs of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Getting ready to become a ninja in all three! 🐱‍💻
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, as long as I learn new things!
- 📫 How to reach me: look for me on Twitter under the alias @djamboOfficial!
